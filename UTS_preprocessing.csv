Mal Ciputra Semarang,Coastal Fjord,3.0,"This is not a mall to ""happily hang out with your friends"", no. This is a mall to get your stuff. Because they are selling various products, pretty complete. Yet so crowded. Quite easy to find motorcycle parking lot, but not with the cars."
Mal Ciputra Semarang,TheWalkingDoctor,4.0,"The oldest mall at Semarang city. This old yet reliable still have it's own unique magnitude even until now. Perhaps it's location is the key: a very strategic location, at the most famous Semarang's icon the ""Simpang Lima"". The building did improved, though not as lavish as the Paragon Mall. The tenants also evolved from the first preference by local tenants, now nearly every international merchants available here. A cinema and arcade games also available. Public facilities are good, it's safe and clean here, unfortunatelly not much chairs available for visitors. The traffic jam and seeking for a parking lot can be very excruciating especially at the weekend."

There is a full service grocery store on the first floor. There were about three or four optometrists stores, four or five cell phone stores in the mall. The visitors in the mall were light. So of the restaurants fine dining and McDonald were busy."
Mal Ciputra Semarang,nabila apriliana,5.0,"Here you can have fun with family, friends, or the other.

On the other hand, the price is not quite expensive."
Mal Ciputra Semarang,Carl Payoyo,4.0,"In general, the place is really good. Very accessible, clean, and complete. However, some shopkeepers take advantage of foreign visitors.

Java Mall,Crisopras ‚ÄúYŒõVL‚Äù Kainama,5.0,"Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission, to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could have never imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America‚Äôs soul and the steel in America‚Äôs spine. Each test forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans, like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery, with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters in the scene used for Hurricane Harvey. 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved power lines ‚Äî downed power lines and deep water to save 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped in a California summer camp, threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, everywhere, we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later. The legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like you, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the capitol police officers, the Alexandria police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others and some in this room ‚Äî of many others, some in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we are elected to serve."
